                The Waste Receiver Assessment Program (WRAP) was initiated by a consortium of petroleum exploration, production, and pipeline companies. The purpose of a WRAP assessment is to determine the environmental exposure and risk associated with the petroleum companies utilizing third party waste receivers for the treatment and disposal of oilfield wastes. The waste receivers provide a wide range of services including, but not limited to, treatment facilities, transfer stations, landfill disposal, sub-surface injection, and incineration facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each year, based on a three year rotational program, a group of waste receivers are selected for the current year program and approved by the consortium.  Wotherspoon Environmental Inc. acts as the administrator and assessor of the program.
